## The Hawbridge Coders Application

This application is written using the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language ([code academy]). To further simplify things, it uses a special ruby 'gem' called [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) ([tutorial]). This 'microframework' makes it easy to create simple web sites and applications by giving you the ability to write a small amount of code which instructs the framework to magically generate a bunch of HTML for you for a given 'page' on your site. 

While there are a couple of files in this repository that are critical for setting up the ruby-sinatra 'infrastructure', the entire website can be coded in a single file, for example [hello.rb](/blob/master/hello.rb).

### Alternatives
There are a number of other ruby frameworks for ruby:

Microframeworks like Sinatra, mainly make it easy to serve a website. If you want to respond to user actions and store information, you will need to write the code to do this yourself.
* [cuba](http://cuba.is/)
* [camping](http://camping.io/)

Larger Frameworks do more things for you, such as providing ways to respond to user input, and store information.
* [rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [volt](http://voltframework.com/)

If you prefer another programming language, you can try many others, and most of them have similar frameworks to help you create websites:

python
* [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) Microframework
* [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Larger Framework

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

As usual, Google is your friend for finding all sorts of others, and finding tutorials for everything.
