This is the base website for the Hawbridge Coding Club.  It will be the foundation for learning to develop a simple web application to be run on (heroku)[https://www.heroku.com/home].

### Creating a Github Account

### Fork this Repository

### Creating a Heroku Account and Free Application

### Linking Heroku and Github

### Managing your Github Repository

### If you are using a School Computer

Because there is no guarantee that you will get the same computer each time you come to coding club, you should make sure that you push all changes that you want to keep to your Github hosted repository, remove your account information from Github Desktop, and clean the working copy from the school computer.  At the beginning of each session, you will need to pull login to Github Desktop, and pull down the latest version of your repository.  This also ensures that you can access your repository in its best state from any computer that you have access to use.

#### To do at the begining of each session

- Open Github Desktop
- Sign in with your Github Account
  - Click 'Github Desktop'
  - Click 'Preferences'
  - Click 'Accounts'
  - Enter your Github User and Password and click 'Sign In'
  - close the Preferences Panel
- Check for pull requests from this repository
  - Navigate to your Github repository website and sign in
  - Switch to the 'master' branch
  - Look for a notification of a Pull Request, either on the main page, or in 'Issues'
  - Click on the Pull Request, and hit 'apply'
- Clone your Github repository into your Desktop
  - click '+'
  - click 'clone'
  - type 'hawbridge_coders' (it should bring up a listing that you can click)
  - Choose 'Desktop' as the destination

#### To do at the end of each session

- Create a branch, and Sync all changes that you want to preserve to this branch on your Github hosted repository
- Remove the repository from Github Desktop
  - Make sure the repository viewer pane is open on the left (click the button with a square with a line on the left side to   
  toggle)
  - 'right' click (or ctrl-click) the 'hawbridge_coders' listing in the repository viewer (same as you do to open in atom)
  - click 'Remove'
- Sign out and remove your login credentials from Github Desktop
  - click 'Github Desktop'
  - click 'Preferences'
