# hawbridge_coders

This is the base website for the Hawbridge Coding Club.  It will be the foundation for learning to develop a simple web application to be run on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).

### Creating a Github Account

Using your browser, navigate to [Github](https://github.com)
Create an acccount. You should use a typical username for yourself (maybe reuse your gmail or facebook username), and a very strong password (10 characters, letters, numbers, spaces, dashes, special characters). You will need to supply an email address, and you will need to be able to login to this email to confirm the account.

You might use this account for a very long time, so make it something that represents you as a person. If you want, you can add a a profile picture/avatar as well. If you already have an account that you can login with, skip this step.

### Fork this Repository

Using your browser, make sure you are viewing [dmlond/hawbridge_coders](https://github.com/dmlond/hawbridge_coders)
Select the master branch.  Click the 'Fork' button. This makes a copy of hawbridge_coders owned and managed by your account. dmlond can never revoke your fork, nor can dmlond make any changes to your copy of the code, except through the mechanism of a pull-request which you can deny.  Note, this repository is Licensed with the [GPL Version 2 Open Source License](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php).  All forks of this repository must also be licensed with the GPL Version 2 license, and refer back to the original dmlond/hawbidge_coders.

### Creating a Heroku Account and Free Application

Using your browser, navigate to [heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login). Click Sign Up.  You can choose any username that you want, but you should probably reuse your github username to make things easy (but use a different password unless you github password is very strong).  You will need to supply an email address, and you will need to be able to login to this email to confirm the account.

Once you login, you will be presented with the Heroku 'Dashboard'. To create your first 'Application' click on the 'Personal Applications' link on the left, then click the '+' button on the top right. Chose 'Create new app'. Name it with your username appended to '-hawbridge-coders' (e.g. mine is called dmlond-hawbridge-coders).

You can create and destroy applications all you want, and you can create multiple applications, so dont worry if you dont like this name. It is just to make it easier to standardize the way we all navigate to your sight when it is live.

### Linking Heroku and Github

There are tons of documentation pages on heroku.  [Github Heroku Integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) is one that will teach you how to link your github account with your heroku account.  This makes it so that you can automatically launch the code from your github repository to make it live on a heroku address.  You should link your hawbridge-coders application with the 'master' branch of your github repository to start with, but you can always change this to a different branch or repository, or turn off automatic deploy and use the dashboard to manually deploy any of your other branches, or even repositories.

### Managing your Github Repository

For hawbridge-coders, you should make sure to keep the 'master' branch the same as the 'master' branch of dmlond/hawbridge_coders. This is not as hard as it sounds. Branching in github is really easy, and you can create as many branches as you want. So, if you want to try something out, first create a branch (some developers name branches for trying things out starting with 'try_', and name known stable versions for deployment starting with 'version' and a number).

### If you are using a School Computer

Because there is no guarantee that you will get the same computer each time you come to coding club, you should make sure that you push all changes that you want to keep to your Github hosted repository, remove your account information from Github Desktop, and clean the working copy from the school computer.  At the beginning of each session, you will need to pull login to Github Desktop, and pull down the latest version of your repository.  This also ensures that you can access your repository in its best state from any computer that you have access to use.

#### To do at the begining of each session

- Open Github Desktop
- Sign in with your Github Account
  - Click 'Github Desktop'
  - Click 'Preferences'
  - Click 'Accounts'
  - Enter your Github User and Password and click 'Sign In'
  - close the Preferences Panel
- Check for pull requests from this repository
  - Navigate to your Github repository website and sign in
  - Switch to the 'master' branch
  - Look for a notification of a Pull Request, either on the main page, or in 'Issues'
  - Click on the Pull Request, and hit 'apply'
- Clone your Github repository into your Desktop
  - click '+'
  - click 'clone'
  - type 'hawbridge_coders' (it should bring up a listing that you can click)
  - Choose 'Desktop' as the destination

#### To do at the end of each session

- Create a branch, and Sync all changes that you want to preserve to this branch on your Github hosted repository
- Remove the repository from Github Desktop
  - Make sure the repository viewer pane is open on the left (click the button with a square with a line on the left side to   
  toggle)
  - 'right' click (or ctrl-click) the 'hawbridge_coders' listing in the repository viewer (same as you do to open in atom)
  - click 'Remove'
- Sign out and remove your login credentials from Github Desktop
  - click 'Github Desktop'
  - click 'Preferences'
  - click 'Sign Out' next to your name
- Open Finder (your file viewer), find the 'hawbridge_coders' folder in the Desktop, and move it to trash. Empty Trash.
